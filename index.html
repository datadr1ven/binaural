        	// In Web Audio you define a digital audio signal path.
        	// You can think of it as a flow chart for a digital audio signal.
        	// An "AudioContext" is an interface for creating such a signal path.
        	// Within the AudioContext you create a network of interconnected
        	// "AudioNodes", each of which performs some task with the audio,
        	// such as generate audio, play existing audio, alter audio, etc.
        	// You need an AudioContext in order to do anything with Web Audio.
        	
            // Create the audio context.
            // Create a variable and assign a new AudioContext to it.
            var myAudioContext = new AudioContext();
            
    		// Create a sound-generating oscillator in that context.
    		// An AudioContext has a "createOscillator()" method to do that.
    		// Create a variable and assign a newly created oscillator to it.
            var myOscillator = myAudioContext.createOscillator();
            // By default, the frequency of a new oscillator is 440 Hz.
            // And by default its amplitude is 1.
            
            // Connect the output of the oscillator to the output of the computer.
            // AudioContext has a "destination" property,
            // which points to the computer's DAC (i.e., the audio output).
            // And any audio source, such as an oscillator, has a
            // "connect()" method to connect its output to something else.
			myOscillator.connect(myAudioContext.destination);
			 
			// Start playing the oscillator immediately when the page loads.
			// An oscillator has a "start()" method to start playing.
			// The argument to start() is the starting time.
			// An AudioContext keeps track of the current time in
			// a property called "currentTime".
			// If the specified start() time is less than or equal to
			// the currentTime of the AudioContext, the event will start.
			// So to make something happen immediately, you can either say
			// "start(0)", which is guaranteed to be less than or equal to
			// the currentTime, or you can start at the currentTime.
			// If you provide no start time, it will be 0 by default.
			// Start the carrier oscillator now.
			myOscillator.start(myAudioContext.currentTime);
			// That's it. The oscillator will start when the page is loaded,
			// and since there's nothing to stop it, it will continue to play
			// until the page is left or the window is closed.
